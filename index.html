        <h1>Yu-Hsin Melissa Chen</h1> <p>I am interested in exploring the different subfileds of physics such as high energy physics and condensed matter physics.

Now I am a undergraduate research assistant at Academia Sinica.</p>
        <h2> My research experience include</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
        ** Condensed Matter Theory at Academia Sinica ** Currently focusing on theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of topological properties in these systems, leading to a new line of inquiry for my research group.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        **Solar Neutrino Oscillation (High Energy Theory) at Academia Sinica :** Developed a modular numerical framework to study neutrino physics, including MSW effects and exploring preliminary models for dark photon-neutrino interactions. (The numerical framework is **publicly available on my GitHub**).
    </li>
    
    <li>
        **LIGO Data Analysis (High Energy Experiment) at Academia Sinica :** Conducted numerical simulations and systematic parameter scans on publicly available LIGO data, focusing on careful problem identification and data interpretation.
    </li>
        </ul>
